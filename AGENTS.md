This repository is equal parts meant to be a way for me to learn NixOS and actual config for my homelab that has to work and be pretty stable, especially smart home-related systems.

Read  the [architecture plan](./ARCHITECTURE.md) carefully to understand the goal for where this repository is headed.

We are loosely following [Wolfgang's repository]/Users/leo/git/notthebee-nix) as an inspiration. Don't blindly copy but always check it when I ask you to add something new that our system doesn't have yet.

I already have a somewhat similar setup but currently all manually set up with rasbian on the pi and Unraid on the server (we're migrating away from that).

I know very little about Nix, so always make sure to explain in detail what we're doing, especially with respect to the Nix language.

Let's document decisions in the README but only important high-level ones, not every implementation detail.
